Have you ever heard of a computer that can do things regular computers can’t? These special computers are called quantum computers. They are different from the computers you use at home or school because they use something called “qubits” instead of regular “bits”. A bit is like a light switch that can only be on or off, like a zero or a one. But a qubit can be both zero and one at the same time! This means quantum computers can do many things at once and work much faster than regular computers. It’s like having many helpers working on a task together instead of just one. One application of it would be quantum cryptography.
